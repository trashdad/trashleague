The Rules
The Draft

Draft will occur on Sleeper
It will be a slow draft with 8 hour picks. This pick timer may be adjusted if the start of the season is imminent and rosters need to be filled before the week 1 snap of the Thursday game.
Autodraft picks might happen. Changes will be made on a case-by-case basis with overwhelming evidence to support a change
3rd round reversal: Normal "snake" drafts begin the 3rd round with the 1st overall draft selecting the 3.01. Instead, the 12th team will have the 3.01 and the snake draft will continue from that point normally (i.e., 1st team gets 3.12 then 4.01, 12th team gets 4.12 then 5.01, etc.)
Draft will begin as soon as the league is full
Draft order will be voted upon. The preference is a derby style selection where one may be chosen to select their draft pick position rather than have it assigned. This will be voted in the group. (Random has been selected)
Each time a pick is made, that manager shall make every effort to contact or "ping" the next team manager to help speed the process along
Draft picks may be traded

Regular Season

Regular season rules and structure will be followed in accordance with Sleeper's default settings
Scoring will be set in Sleeper and will deviate from "normal" ESPN or Yahoo settings. It is your responsibility to take note in Sleeper!
Trades will be shut off at the start of the fantasy playoffs (week 14)
Normal head-to-head matches will be followed each week with median scoring enacted.
Median scoring FAQ
Teams with the 1st and 2nd overall best record will get first-round byes
Winner of the league will receive $200, 2nd will get $75, and 3rd will get $25 _2021 rules_

Inactive Team Clause: Commissioner reserves the right to ensure a fun, competitive environment for everyone in the league. Free wins hurt everyone in the long run. Thus, a rule will be established where managers have 1 "freebie" whereby if they fail to set their lineups they will not be penalized. However, subsequent failings to set a lineup will be met with a commissioner setting the lineup on behalf of the team and ensuring a full lineup is set every week. If the team is abandoned, a replacement will be found as soon as possible. If there are extenuating circumstances, team managers are expected to contact the commissioner to make arrangements.

Waivers

Waivers will be done traditional style with them being processed weekly on Tuesday night/Wednesday morning
Waiver structure will be FAAB. Everyone starts with X number of FAAB dollars and can bid on players in a blind auction style. FAAB can be traded and no additional FAAB will be awarded in 2021 for any reason.

Keeper Rules

At the end of the season, each team manager may designate 3 players to keep into the next year.
Each year, the draft round taken will be increased by 1. First round players cannot be kept. Thus, a player taken in the 5th will cost a 4th round draft pick next year
This persists through trades and drops during the season and resets during the following year's draft
Maximum number of years a player can be kept is 5 years (total of 4 years ownership. Initial draft/pickup then 2 years of keeper status)
Waiver pickups cost a 12th round pick. If the team wishes to keep 2 waiver pickups, the second will cost their 11th round pick
Teams will not be forced to keep a player
Future draft picks can be traded (this may not be supported in Sleeper and is subject to change based on how much work it is to keep track of picks)
